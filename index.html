  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3>
      I love writing, composition, and how we express ourselves and thoughts through the written language. Hand in hand with this, I enjoy interviewing and getting to know people. It has come to my attention I don't have the greatest proficiency with coding/more technical matters, but I put a good effort forward. That's what counts, right?

  <h2>Potential Project</h2>
      <h3>I've been trying to write a book for a while now. I want to use the narrative device to explore questions of how what it means to be human is understood through a modern, computationally-informed context. A lot of the story is centered around the pursuit of understanding through technology and a lack of tangible, social interaction (and either the futility or ability to do so). I feel being able to create an interactive, online presence for this story is apt for the themes, and can lend otherwise inaccessible accompanyments to the story (i.e music, non-linear progression, interactive footnotes, etc)</h3>

   <h2>Looking forwards</h2>
      <h3>I'm planning on going to grad school to become a LCSW, intent to use my education in technology and narrative to serve people in understanding how our digital existence affects our formation of self (which is a narrative itself, but that's a different conversation). On the side, I'd like to continue to write, and this current project would be a nice springboard to do so. And, if all goes well and according to plan, I would like to be of some service to the world.</h3>
